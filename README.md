## 💻 Overview about my Webbside
I started this webbsite project as a fun and challenging side project in early November of 2025. The webbsite features a main menu which gives a brief introduction about me, links to other sites you can find me on, what work I've done before and what i do now and last but not least ways you can contact me. 

## 📙 Features 
- Animated partical background (Random colors) 
- Glow effect (Paricals + modals and menu)
- Draggable modals (touch/mouse support) 

## 📋 programs used to achive this 
I've used Html, Css and JavaScript to make my webbsite. I've also used favicon.io (for my favicon) and howlerjs.com (for the sounds on the webbsite). 

## 🔮 Future plans 
- Option for Swedish text
- Optimise the view and layout for Ipad and Phone users 
- Uppdating the webbsite when I need to add / change information about what I do or work I've done.
