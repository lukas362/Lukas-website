## 💻 Overview about my website
I started this website project as a fun and challenging side project in late Octover /  early November of 2025. The website features a main menu which gives a brief introduction about me, links to other sites you can find me on, what work I've done before and what i do now and last but not least ways you can contact me. 

## 📙 Features 
- Animated partical background (Specific colors) 
- Glow effect (Particals + modals and menu)
- Draggable modals (touch/mouse support)
- Favicon
- LocalStorage 
- Viewport support for diffrent devices 

## 📋 Programs used to achieve this 
I used Html, Css and JavaScript to make my webbsite. I've also used favicon.io (for my favicon) and howlerjs.com (for the sounds on the webbsite). 

## 🔮 Future plans 
- Option for Swedish text
- Sound effects
- Optimise the view and layout for Ipad and Phone users ✔
- Uppdating the webbsite when I need to add / change information about what I do or work I've done.
